Multibly
Instruction Set:
1) Load R0 with 00
2) Load R1 with 00 (ANSWER)
3) Load R2 with 02 (OPERAND 1)
4) Load R3 with 04 (OPERAND 2)
5) Load R4 with FF (DECREMENTER)
6) Add R2 with R1 into R1
7) Add R3 with R4 into R3
8) Comp R3 with R0 -> PRINT
9) Comp R0 with R0 -> STEP 6

Explanation:
We are multiplying 2 by 4 using repetitve addition
We load R0 with 0, R1 with 0 in ASCII (result), R2 with 2 (n1), R3 with 4 (n2), R4 with FF (-1)
We add R2 with R1 and store the result in R1
We subtract 1 from R3 by adding R4 to it
We compare R3 to R0, if R3 reaches 0 then we have added R1 to itself R3 times, so we can print and jump to HALT
If R3 doesn't equal R0 we then compare R0 to R0, which will always be true, so we jump to step 6

Expected Output:
8
